\description{
Material-flux networks (dry mass DM) of a dry moss turf community (Antarctic dry tundra) and a wet moss
carpet commnity (Antarctic wet tundra) at Signy Island, South Orkney Islands.
Includes flow matrix, biomasses, assimilation and growth efficiencies, natural
death rates, and representative taxa.

\details{
Two food web models are available for the Antarctic tundra: a dry moss turf
community (\code{Antarctic_tundra_dry}) and a wet moss carpet community
(\code{Antarctic_tundra_wet}).
It is a material flux network, with fluxes in the unit milligram dry mass per square meter
per year (mg DM m-2 yr-1). Conversion from material to energy fluxes was heavility dependent
on assumptions and broad extrapolation, and therefore not undertaken.
The data for these models was collected on Signy Island, South Orkney Islands.
The communities are relatively simple networks with poorly developed trophic structure.
The compartments (n = 23 for dry, and n = 18 for wet tundra) are trophic groups, but tend
towards single species dominance. Therefore, a list with corresponding representative taxa
is also included.
\cr
\cr
The food web model is constructed as in Neutel & Thorne (2014), with data taken from their
supplementary material or from the original source in literature.
All fluxes are inferred from measured respiration rates, collected over multiple years
(Davis 1981), generalized conversion efficiencies (Heal & Maclean 1975, Hunt et al. 1987),
and feeding preferences (Davis 1981).
Some feeding preferences were not provided by Davis (1981), in which case
specific assumptions were made and tested for ecosystem stability (details in supplementary
material of Neutel & Thorne 2014).
All consumers feed on detritus, algae, moss, or other consumers. Faecal material, exuviae,
and carcasses from all organisms flow back into the detritus compartment. The moss and algae
compartments are not seen as consumer compartments in this food web model.
\cr
\cr
Consumption rates per consumer (Qj, mg DM m-2 yr-2) was calculated as
$Q_j = \frac{R_j}{a_j(1-p_j)}$,
where Rj is annual respiration of the consumer, a is the assimilation efficiency, and
p is the production efficiency.
\cr
\cr
Consumption of resource i by consumer j (Fij) was calculated using diet proportions:
$Fij = pijQj$, where pij is the diet proportion of i in the diet of j. The given diet
proportions in Neutel & Thorne (2014) did not always exactly add up to one.
In those cases rounding error were assumed and fixed before calculating the consumption fluxes.
\cr
\cr
Feedback back to detritus was the sum of egestion and non-predatory mortality of all
consumers.
Egestion is $E_{ij} = (1-a_j)*F_{ij}$
Mortality is $M_j = a_j * p_j * F_{ij} - F_{ji}$
\cr
\cr
The mortality rate \code{MR} is calculated as the mortality flow divided by the biomass.
